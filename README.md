A practice journal for musicians

As a learning journey, I want to try to recreate an app that I enjoyed a lot when studying music called MusicJournal.
It has since been deprecated, and other subscription-based apps have taken it's place, however I want to try to make
an app that will be affordable with a one time purchase.
